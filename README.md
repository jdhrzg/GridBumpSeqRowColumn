# GridBumpSeqRowColumn

-- WORKING COPY - FULL AND POLISHED README COMING AFTER CODE IS DONE --

Notable challenges (rough notes for Jerod to write on in future)
1. The different ways you can do Grid.Row and Grid.Column
2. If value changes from single digit "1" to double digit "11" then that messes up the matches found futher along in the string.
